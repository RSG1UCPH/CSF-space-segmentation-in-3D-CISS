# CSF-space-segmentation-in-3D-CISS
This automatic pipeline for fully non-invasive cerebral-spinal fluid volumetry introduces an analytical algorithm for objective and SNR-independent (within good range of SNRs) delineation of highly T2-weighted CSF space regions form 3D-CISS images of the mouse brain.
